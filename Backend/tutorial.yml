- title: Hello World
  content: Let us start with our first Hello World program
  code: "program hello\r\n  ! This is a comment line; it is ignored by the compiler\r\n
    \ print *, 'Hello, World!'\r\nend program hello\r\n"
- title: Declaring variables
  content: Variable names must start with a letter and can consist of letters, numbers and underscores. In the following example we declare a variable for each of the built-in types.
  code: "program variables\r\n  implicit none\r\n\r\n  integer :: amount\r\n  real :: pi\r\n  complex :: frequency\r\n  character :: initial\r\n  logical :: isOkay\r\n\r\nend program variables"
- title: Declaring variables
  content: Once we have declared a variable, we can assign and reassign values to it using the assignment operator =.
  code: "program variables\r\n  implicit none\r\n\r\n  integer :: amount\r\n  real :: pi\r\n  complex :: frequency\r\n  character :: initial\r\n  logical :: isOkay\r\n\r\n  amount = 10\r\n  pi = 3.1415927\r\n  frequency = (1.0, -0.5)\r\n  initial = 'A'\r\n  isOkay = .false.\r\nend program variables"
- title: Standard output
  content: We can use the print statement introduced earlier to print variable values to stdout
  code: "program variables\r\n  implicit none\r\n\r\n  integer :: amount\r\n  real :: pi\r\n  complex :: frequency\r\n  character :: initial\r\n  logical :: isOkay\r\n\r\n  amount = 10\r\n  pi = 3.1415927\r\n  frequency = (1.0, -0.5)\r\n  initial = 'A'\r\n  isOkay = .false.\r\n  \r\n  print *, 'The value of amount (integer) is: ', amount\r\n  print *, 'The value of pi (real) is: ', pi\r\n\r\nend program variables"
- title: Standard input
  content: In a similar way, we can read values from the command window using the read statement. Enter values in the box below.
  code: "program read_value\r\n  implicit none\r\n  integer :: age\r\n\r\n  print *, 'Please enter your age: '\r\n  read(*,*) age\r\n\r\n  print *, 'Your age is: ', age\r\n\r\nend program read_value"
